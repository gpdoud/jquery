# Assignment: Using multiple form controls
Create a page that has multiple form controls on it that represents your profile page on some web site. The page should have:

  * You name (first and last)
  * Cell phone
  * Email
  * Your password (hidden)
  * Your password again to verify
  * A dropdown list of cities (at least 5) that include the city you live in.
  * Radio button to pick the state you live in
  * A set of check boxes for music:
  	** I like heavy metal
  	** I like rock & roll
  	** I like country
  	** I like hip/hop
  	** I like classical
  	** I like bluegrass

Include a button that can be clicked after all selections are made.

Near the password fields, display some indicator whether the two password fields have the exact same text including case (you can use a checkbox and check it if they match)

In a label control at the bottom of all the other controls, display verbiage that shows the values of all the controls in text format. (e.g. "I DO like heavy metal. I DO NOT like country.")

## ADVANCED CHALLENGE

From the data, construct a javascript Object that contains all the entered/selected profile data. Display it in the console log (e.g. console.log(profileObject))
